These are the two very busy shopping days where shoppers spend millions online.\\n\\nEvery eye will be on retailers to ensure that consumers' online shopping experiences are straightforward and, most importantly, secure. So, at the major part, retailers need to pay attention to extra security measures in order to prevent themselves from massive data breaches, like Target data breach that occurred last year during the Black Friday sales in which over 40 million Credit & Debit cards were stolen.\\n\\nNot just Target alone, multiple retailers including Neiman Marcus, Michaels Store were also targeted during last Christmas holiday, involving the heist of possibly 110 million Credit-Debit cards, and personal information.\\n\\nSo, in an effort to secure yourself from scammers you need to be aware of some top scams and tips to keep yourself safe online.\\n\\n1. COPYCAT & FAKE WEBSITES\\nIn order to fraud an online account holder's financial information, scammers could pose their website as a legitimate one. Like you got an email from Amazan.com for the hottest deals, and not Amazon, make sure before providing your financial details.\\n\\nCheck properly thrice who emails are from and if it's an unknown, best way is to avoid the email and the so-called hottest deal. Always go for a website using an HTTPS URL, before entering a password or any information like address or credit card number.\\n\\nThere are thousands of websites that closely resemble legitimate domains like Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Apart from these, there are so many new sites offering online shopping, that it's quite difficult for customers to say which one is legitimate and which is not.\\n\\nMany of these websites host exciting contests or advertisements for dodgy services to gain your attention and force your finger to click it, while others host malware that can infect your system when you browse to these websites.\\n\\nSo, to be in safer side, always shop from websites which you or your friends know. Just keep one thing in mind while shopping online that Website ratings and security seals can be faked and the website could look too good to be true, but probably it's not.\\n\\n2. PHISHING WEBSITES\\nPhishing scams are typically fraudulent email messages, masquerading as a well known and trustworthy entity in an attempt to gather personal and financial information from victims. However, phishing attacks have become more sophisticated recently.\\n\\nKeep an eye on scams emails claiming to come from legitimate sources which will ask you to visit a website actually hosted by cyber crooks in order to steal your personal information like email addresses, passwords, credit card numbers, expiration date, verification code, and more.\\n\\nAlways type website name in Google Search Engine and then visit the particular website from those search results, instead visiting through any link provided in messages or emails. Don't go to websites you've never heard of.\\n\\n3. UNEXPECTED GIFTS SCAM\\nA year ago during Black Friday, one of the major scams was the cyber criminals offering $1,000 Best Buy gift cards, which nobody won. But, a lot of people ended up in giving away their personal information for no reason at all.\\n\\nOnline users are recommended to avoid such \\\"unexpected gifts\\\" scams, just like your dear ones recommend you to not accept unexpected gifts from strangers. Emails could be a major medium to offer you unwanted gifts, so be careful when opening attachments you receive by email - that special delivery could end up costing you.\\n\\n4. FAKE ADS AND COUPONS\\nCustomers on holiday season are always on search for great deals, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but your just a small mistake can lead you to danger. Miscreants use your desires by creating 'click-bait' ads or posting links to 'the best deal ever', which will always lead to either a survey, a scam site or even drive-by exploits.\\n\\nCustomers are advised to treat such offers with skepticism, especially when the source is unknown and unfamiliar to you. You are also advised to keep an updated Antivirus software onto their systems, so if any convincing advert does trick you and gain your click, your AV protects you against infection.\\n\\nIn addition to fake ads for Best Buy, users also want to look out for fake online coupons in general. If it sounds too good to be true, visit directly to reputable websites, and, by some miracle, the offer is true because it's Black Friday sales, it's all yours.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Security researchers have uncovered nine vulnerabilities affecting four TCP/IP stacks impacting more than 100 million consumer and enterprise devices that could be exploited by an attacker to take control of a vulnerable system.\\nDubbed \\\"NAME:WRECK\\\" by Forescout and JSOF, the flaws are the latest in series of studies undertaken as part of an initiative called Project Memoria to study the security of widely-used TCP/IP stacks that are incorporated by various vendors in their firmware to offer internet and network connectivity features.\\n\\\"These vulnerabilities relate to Domain Name System (DNS) implementations, causing either Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to take target devices offline or to take control over them,\\\" the researchers said.\\nThe name comes from the fact that parsing of domain names can break (i.e., \\\"wreck\\\") DNS implementations in TCP/IP stacks, adding to a recent uptick in vulnerabilities such as SigRed, SAD DNS, and DNSpooq that leverage the \\\"phonebook of the internet\\\" as an attack vector.\\nThey also mark the fifth time security weaknesses have been identified in the protocol stacks that underpin millions of internet-connected devices \\u2014\\nURGENT/11\\nRipple20\\nAMNESIA:33, and\\nNUMBER:JACK\\nSpecifically, the latest research offers a closer look at the \\\"message compression\\\" scheme used in the DNS protocol that \\\"eliminates the repetition of domain names in a message\\\" with the intent of reducing the size of messages, uncovering multiple flaws in FreeBSD (12.1), IPnet (VxWorks 6.6), Nucleus NET (4.3), and NetX (6.0.1) stacks.\\nIn a plausible real-world attack scenario, adversaries can exploit these flaws to find their way into an organization's network via an internet-facing device that issues DNS requests to a server and exfiltrate sensitive information, or even use them as a stepping stone to sabotage critical equipment.\\nWith the exception of IPnet, FreeBSD, Nucleus NET, and NetX have all released patches, requiring device vendors using vulnerable versions of the software to ship an updated firmware to their customers.\\nBut as with the previous flaws, there are several hurdles to applying the fixes, what with the lack of information regarding the TCP/IP stack that runs on a device, the difficulty in delivering patches because the devices are not centrally managed, or they cannot be taken offline due to their central role in mission-critical processes like healthcare and industrial control systems.\\nIn other words, besides the effort required to identify all the vulnerable devices, it could take a considerable amount of time before the security patches trickle down from the stack vendor to the firmware of the device.\\nEven worse, in some cases, it may never be feasible to push a patch, as a result of which many of the impacted devices will most likely remain exposed to attacks for years to come or until they are decommissioned.\\nWhile a quick fix may not be in sight, the bright spot in the findings is that there are mitigations that make it easier to detect attempts to take advantage of these flaws. For a start, Forescout has released an open-source script to detect devices running the affected stacks. In addition, the researchers also recommend enforcing network segmentation controls until the patches are in place and monitoring all network traffic for malicious packets that attempt to exploit flaws targeting DNS, mDNS, and DHCP clients.\\nThe study is also expected to be presented at the Black Hat Asia 2021 conference on May 6, 2021.\\n\\\"NAME:WRECK is a case where bad implementations of a specific part of an RFC can have disastrous consequences that spread across different parts of a TCP/IP stack and then different products using that stack,\\\" the researchers said.\\n\\\"It is also interesting that simply not implementing support for compression (as seen for instance in lwIP) is an effective mitigation against this type of vulnerability. Since the bandwidth saving associated with this type of compression is almost meaningless in a world of fast connectivity, we believe that support for DNS message compression currently introduces more problems than it solves.\\\"\\n\\n\",\n          \"Cybersecurity researchers from Intego are warning about possible active exploitation of an unpatched security vulnerability in Apple's macOS Gatekeeper security feature details and PoC for which were publicly disclosed late last month.\\n\\nIntego team last week discovered four samples of new macOS malware on VirusTotal that leverage the GateKeeper bypass vulnerability to execute untrusted code on macOS without displaying users any warning or asking for their explicit permission.\\n\\nHowever, the newly discovered malware, dubbed OSX/Linker, has not been seen in the wild as of now and appears to be under development. Though the samples leverage unpatched Gatekeeper bypass flaw, it does not download any malicious app from the attacker's server.\\n\\nAccording to Joshua Long from Intego, until last week, the \\\"malware maker was merely conducting some detection testing reconnaissance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One of the files was signed with an Apple Developer ID (as explained below), it is evident that the OSX/Linker disk images are the handiwork of the developers of the OSX/Surfbuyer adware,\\\" Long said in a blog post.\\n\\nHowever, since the malware sample links to a remote server from where it downloads the untrusted app, attackers can also distribute same samples to real targeted by merely replacing the defined sample app with a malware app on their server.\\n\\nmacOS Gatekeeper Bypass Vulnerability\\n\\nGateKeeper is a security feature built into Apple macOS that enforces code signing and verifies downloaded applications before allowing them to run, helping users protect their systems from malware and other malicious software.\\nThat means, if you download an application from the Internet, GateKeeper will only allow it to execute without any warnings if it has been signed with a valid Apple-issued certificate, otherwise will prompt you to allow or deny the execution.\\n\\nHowever, Gatekeeper has been designed to treat both external drives (USB or HDD) and network shares as \\\"safe locations\\\" from where users can run any application without involving GateKeeper's checks and prompts.\\n\\nFilippo Cavallarin, an independent security researcher, late last month publicly revealed a way to exploit this behavior by combining it with two other legitimate features of macOS operating system, which are:\\n\\nzip archives can contain symbolic links pointing to an arbitrary location, including automount endpoints, and\\nautomount feature on macOS can automatically mount a network share from a remote server just by accessing it with a \\\"special\\\" path i.e., beginning with \\\"/net/.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For example, ls /net/evil-attacker.com/sharedfolder/ will make the OS read the content of the 'sharedfolder' on the remote host (evil-attacker.com) using NFS,\\\" Cavallarin explained in a blog post.\\n\\nAs shown in the video demonstration, Cavallarin created a ZIP file with a symbolic link to an attacker-controlled network share that macOS will automount.\\n\\nOnce a victim opens the ZIP archive and follows the link, he will navigate to the attacker-controlled network share that's trusted by Gatekeeper, tricking the victim into running malicious executable files without any warning.\\n\\n\\\"The way Finder is designed (ex hide .app extensions, hide full path from title bar) makes this technique very effective and hard to spot,\\\" the researcher says.\\n\\nHowever, the newly discovered malware samples are not ZIP files, but disk image files (with .dmg), showing that \\\"malware makers were experimenting to see whether Cavallarin's vulnerability would work with disk images, too.\\\"\\n\\nCavallarin responsibly reported his findings to Apple on February 22 but decided to go public late last month after the company failed to patch the issue within the 90 days disclosure deadline and started ignoring his emails.\\n\\nUntil Apple patches this issue, researcher advised network administrators to block NFS communications with external IP addresses, and for home users, it is always important to not open email attachments from an unknown, suspicious, or untrustworthy source.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Malware\",\n          \"Cyber_Attack\",\n          \"Data_Breaches\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
